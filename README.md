In this repository, i have uploaded coding and model training codes.
The trained model saved in .h and .json file type which is above github's 25 mb limit. So i can't upload the dataset and the trained model.
The dataset is taken from kaggles. For face we use CASME II dataset and for voice we use RAVDESS dataset.
At last in multimodel lie_detector.py, the two models are combined and displayed output with the help of camera and microphone.
